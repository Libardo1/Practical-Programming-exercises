True and not False
# 2. True
True or True and False
# 3. True
not True or not False
# 4. True
True and not 0
# 5. True
52 < 52.3
# 6. False (+ takes precedence over <)
1 + 52 < 52.3

x = 1
y = 2

# 1. Write an expression that evaluates to True if both variables are True and that evaluates to False otherwise.
x == 1 and y == 2
x == 1 and y != 2

# 2. Write an expression that evaluates to True if x is False and evaluates to False otherwise.
not x != 1
not x == 1

# 3. Write an expression that evaluates to True if at least one of the variables is True and evaluates to False otherwise.
x == 1 or y == 2
x == 1 or y != 2
x != 1 or y != 2

# 4.
full = False
empty = False

full + empty == 1

# 5.
