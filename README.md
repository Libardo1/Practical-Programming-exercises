# Practical-Programming-exercises

This repo contains all of my notes and exercises from 'Practical Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python (1st edition)'.
* The folder 'Own notes' contains .py scripts with my notes from Chapters 4-15.
* The folder 'Scripts from book' contains an incomplete list of .py scripts copied directly from the book.

I highly recommend this book as both an introduction and a refresher to Python!
