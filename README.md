# Practical-Programming-exercises

This repo contains all of my notes and exercises from 'Practical Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python (1st edition)'.
* The folder 'Own notes' contains .py scripts with my notes from Chapters 4-15.
  * Chapter 4: Modules
  * Chapter 5: Lists
  * Chapter 6: Making Choices (Boolean logic and conditional statements)
  * Chapter 7: Repetition (loops)
  * Chapter 8: File Processing
  * Chapter 9: Sets and Dictionaries
  * Chapter 10: Algorithms
  * Chapter 11: Searching and Sorting
  * Chapter 12: Construction (including testing and exceptions)
  * Chapter 13: Object-Oriented Programming
  * Chapter 14: Graphical User Interfaces
  * Chapter 15: Databases (using SQLite3)
* The folder 'Scripts from book' contains an incomplete list of .py scripts copied directly from the book.

I highly recommend this book as both an introduction and a refresher to Python!
